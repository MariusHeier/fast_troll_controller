#Why make it?
I wanne live in a world where an "amateur" can build the fastest gaming controller.
It's good trolling. Which... gives its name.. Troll.

#WHAT IS A FAST CONTROLLER?
All movement you do to the controller is known by the computer as close to 1ms as possible (or faster).

#How can you help?
Software:
	You know Rust, C, Assembly, or any other way it can be coded. Let me know if you wanne participate. I will send you a free board to test.
General questions:
	Check out the current questions at the bottom of these documents.

#Current questions?:
Does anyone know any pro players that uses a controller on a pc?
USB3 vs USB2, should we use RP2040 for computer communication or WCH569(usb3)?
USB3 HID gamepad class? Polling rate 8000hz? 1000hz?
